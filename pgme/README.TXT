DEFAULTS        Default, built-in themes, language strings and other settings.
DOCS            For now, just the PGME Manual--BlahBlah Text
FONTS           QuickCrt QFont files used by PGME for Language Specific Text
                and just for fun.
KEYBOARD        Keyboard keystroke and command event mapping files. Unless
                you want to rebind keys like ALT+Q to some other key or
                language appropriate value, you probably won't want to mess
                with them.
LANGUAGE        Language translation files. However do to the varying length
                of text in different languages, you may want to associate
                the language with a specific custom theme.
MENU            Default "shipped" menu files.
THEMES          Custom fun and language specific themes for PGME.
