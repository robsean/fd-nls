At present, you should not submit updates to any translations for the HTMLHELP
project directly to this repository. It is managed outside of FD-NLS and those
changes get incorporated here.

If you find an issue with one of the translations, want to update or provide
additional translations, please create an "issue" regarding it. We can then put
you in direct contact with the individual who manages the HTMLHELP files.
