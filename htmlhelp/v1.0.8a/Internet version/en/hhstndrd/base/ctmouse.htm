<h1>Command: ctmouse (Cutemouse)</h1>
<pre>
  CuteMouse (CTMOUSE) is the FreeDOS mouse driver.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  ctmouse [options]
  LH ctmouse [options]
  LOADHIGH ctmouse [options]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /3        force 3-button mode (for Microsoft and PS/2 mice only).
  /B        Cancel run if mouse services are already present.
  /L        Swap left and right button.
  /M        Try *old* Mouse Systems / Genius for non-PnP mice.
  /N        Load CuteMouse as new TSR, even if CuteMouse is already
            loaded (useful for batch files which unload CuteMouse
            at end).
  /O        Enable PS2 and BIOS USB wheel detection (might hang).
  /P        Force PS/2 mouse mode.
  /R[h[v]]  Horizontal / vertical resolution: h,v = 1-9, or 0 for auto.
            (no value = use default: auto for h, or "as h" for v).
  /S[c[i]]  Force serial mouse mode at COM port c (c=1-4, default is
            COM1) with IRQ line i (i=2-7, default is IRQ4 for COM 1/3
            and IRQ3 for COM 2/4).
  /U        Uninstall driver, remove TSR from memory.
  /V        Reverse search: find PS/2 after serial mouse.
  /Y        Forces serial mouse search, but, unlike option /S, doesn't
            disable PS/2 support.
  /W        Do not allow CuteMouse to move itself into UMB.
  /?        Shows the help.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  CTMOUSE does not support USB mice.
  CTMOUSE can be loaded in <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> / <a href="../cnfigsys/fdconfig.htm">FDCONFIG.SYS</a> or in
  <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a> or in the command line.
  CTMOUSE2 is a new branching of CuteMouse which supports the mouse
  wheel. It provides a wheel API (application programmer's interface),
  so that FreeDOS programs can use the mouse wheel.
  Visit the CuteMouse website at <b>http://cutemouse.sourceforge.net</b>
  CTMOUSE has the following <a href="../batch/if.htm#comment">EXITCODES (ERRORLEVEL)</a>:
    0  PS/2, Microsoft or Logitech mouse found and CTMOUSE installed;
       Unload successful; /? option used.
    1  CTMOUSE installed in Mouse Systems mode;
       Unload failed because CTMOUSE was not loaded.
    2  Resident part switched to PS/2, Microsoft or Logitech mode;
       Unload failed because driver interrupts were intercepted.
    3  Resident part switched to Mouse Systems mode.
    4  Mouse services already present (returned for option /B only).
    5  Mouse not found; Invalid option used.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  IN CONFIG.SYS / FDCONFIG.SYS:
    devicehigh=C:\fdos\bin\ctmouse  loads ctmouse into high memory
  IN AUTOEXEC.BAT OR IN COMMAND LINE:
    lh ctmouse  loads ctmouse into high memory
    ctmouse /u  unloads the mouse driver
    ctmouse /?  Shows the help (options)
