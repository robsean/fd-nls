<h1>Command: buffers</h1>
<pre>
  BUFFERS tells FreeDOS how many disk buffers it should allocate.
  BUFFERS is a <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> / <a href="../cnfigsys/fdconfig.htm">FDCONFIG.SYS</a> command. 
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  buffers=nn[,m]
    nn  is the number of primary disk buffers, in the range 1-99.
    m   is the number of secondary disk buffers, in the range 1-8.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  Usage:

  The default setting depends on the amount of conventional memory 
  your system has:

  Memory (KB)                Primary Buffers           Secondary Buffers
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    &lt; 128                           3                         1
  128 - 255                         5                         1
  256 - 511                        10                         1
  512 - 640                        15                         1
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  Increasing the number of BUFFERS can improve the speed of programs 
  that work with a large number of files, but also uses up more 
  memory resources.
  The secondary buffer option is available for compatibility with
  other DOS kernels, but is ignored by the FreeDOS kernel. In MS DOS,
  a secondary buffer can used to read-ahead data. FreeDOS does not do
  this. Buffers are stored in HMA by FreeDOS, unless you select nn to
  allocate more buffers than fit in HMA. If nn is smaller, unused HMA
  space will be used for further buffers until something else allocates
  the HMA space for something else. Even then, at least nn buffers will
  always be available. You can set nn to a negative value to disable
  the use of unused HMA space: BUFFERS=-10 only uses 10 buffers, further
  free space in the HMA will just stay unused.
  BUFFERS is a command internal to kernel.sys and needs no other file
  in order to work.

<pre>
  IN CONFIG.SYS / FDCONFIG.SYS:
    buffers=3,1
