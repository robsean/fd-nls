<h1>Command: pushd</h1>
<pre>
  PUSHD pushes current directory onto the directory stack, 
  with the option to change current working directory.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  PUSHD [[drive]path] [/?]
        [[drive]path] is a path to which you wish to change.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /?  Shows the help.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  PUSHD is a lot like CD, except that it stores the current directory
  before changing it. Later on, <a href="../command/popd.htm">POPD</a> can be used to restore it. 
  PUSHD can be used several times, storing a stack of directories.
  Using PUSHD without specifying a directory will store the current 
  directory, but not change it.
  PUSHD is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
this command            changes the current directory to / shows:
============            =========================================cd c:\fdos\bin          c:\fdos\bin
pushd c:\games          c:\games      (and stores c:\fdos\bin)
pushd c:\utils          c:\utils      (and stores c:\games)
pushd c:\packages       c:\packages   (and stores c:\utils)
dirs                    shows the directories stored by pushd:
                          0001=c:\fdos\bin
                          0002=c:\games
                          0003=c:\utils
popd                    c:\utils      (and removes c:\utils (0003)
                                      from directory stack)
popd                    c:\games      (and removes c:\games (0002)
                                      from directory stack)
popd                    c:\fdos\bin   (and removes c:\fdos\bin (0001)
                                      from directory stack)
popd                    shows the message: 
                          "Directory stack empty"
