<h1>Command: xgrep</h1>
<pre>
  XGREP is a program for searching text files based on the UNIX utility
  GREP. You can use XGREP to:
    - display the lines in a file that contain a particular word,
      phrase or pattern;
    - count those lines in which a particular pattern occurs; or
      generate a list of files that refer to a given topic.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  xgrep [-chlnsvyorx] expression [files]
  xgrep [/chlnsvyorx] expression [files]
        expression  the expression to search, may also be classes.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  -c  Line count only.
  -h  No file names.
  -l  File names only.
  -n  Number of lines.
  -o  Errors to stdout - error messages will be redirected along with
      standard output.
  -r  Recursively search subdirectories - looks for files not only in
      the specified directory but in all the subdirectories of that
      directory.
  -s  Silent about inaccessible files.
  -v  Non-matching lines - "inverts" the result of any match.
  -x  No magic: all operators need '\'. The -x option causes the 
      ordinarily "special" characters: . [ * + ? ^ $ to be parsed, by
      default, as literals. For example, the following commands are
      equivalent:
        xgrep    "p\[0] \* 3" test.c
        xgrep -x "p[0] * 3"   test.c
      All regular expression operators are still accessible, but must
      be preceded by a \ (backslash).
  -y  Case-insensitive match - matching is not case-sensitive.
  Two further options are supported as aliases for other options:
  -d  is an alias for -r.
  -i  is an alias for -y.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  Like GREP, XGREP works best on plain text files: the sort of files
  that do not contain binary data or non-ASCII control characters, and
  which are divided into lines or records ending in a '\n' (newline).
  XGREP supports text files in both UNIX (LF) and MS-DOS (CR, LF)
  formats.
  In XGREP, the : (colon) may be used to refer to predefined classes.
  The twelve predefined classes, together with their definitions, are as
  follows:
    :a  Alpha  alphabetic   [A-Za-z]       =ASCII range: 65-90,97-122
    :c  Cntrl  control                     =ASCII range: 0-31,127
    :d  Digit  digits       [0-9]          =ASCII range: 48-57
    :g  Graph  graphics     [!-&tilde;]          =ASCII range: 33-126
    :l  Lower  lowercase    [a-z]          =ASCII range: 97-122
    :n  Alnum  alphanumeric [0-9A-Za-z]    =ASCII range: 48-57,65-90,
                                                         97-122
    :p  Punct  punctuation  [!-/:-@[-`{-&tilde;] =ASCII range: 33-47,58-64,
                                                         91-96, 123-126
    :s  Space  whitespace                  =ASCII range: 9-13,32
    :t  Print  printable    [ -&tilde;]          =ASCII range: 32-126
    :u  Upper  uppercase    [A-Z]          =ASCII range: 65-90
    :x  Xdigit hex digits   [0-9A-Fa-f]    =ASCII range: 48-57,65-70,
                                                         97-102
    :z  ASCII                              =ASCII range: 0-127

  Signs to specify the context:
    ^    Start of line
    $    End of line
    .    Wildcard
    []   Character class
    [^]  Inverse Class
    \    Quote next character
  Repeat:
    *        0 or more times
    +        1 or more times
    ?        0 or 1 times
    \{m\}    m times
    \{m,\}   m or more times
    \{m,u\}  m to u times
  For more information about ":" and "signs to specify the context"
  please read XGREP.DOC.
  XGREP has the following <a href="../batch/if.htm#comment">EXITCODES (ERRORLEVEL)</a>:
    0  At least one match found.
    1  No matches found.
    2  Error(s) occurred.
