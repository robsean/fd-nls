<h1>Command: foxcalc</h1>
<pre>
  FOXCALC is a simple calculator for DOS with a text user 
  interface. The program has a mouse suport, so take care to run
  your mouse driver before launching FOXCALC; it will be much
  easier to use it.

  If you really can't use a mouse, you will find below the list of
  shortcut keys. That list should automatically appear anyway if 
  FoxCalc can't find a mouse driver.

  CALCULATION
  FoxCalc makes use of the GMP (Gnu Multi-Precision) library and
  the MPFR library for all calculations. This makes it an accurate
  and very reliable tool. All operations are performed with a
  precision of 60 digits. Floating point numbers which don't fit
  into the window are truncated without any rounding.
  When using the MOD function in FoxCalc, you can get different results
  than in other computer calculators or programming languages. That's
  not a bug. The modulo operation on negative numbers can be done
  using several methods.
  Usually, computers process an "X MOD Y" operation using absolute
  values of X and Y, and change the result's sign to the X's sign.
  That's the easiest way, and that's how Intel processors work. FoxCalc
  behaves differently. Therefore, the "7 mod -3" operation may be
  computed as "1" on other calculators, while FoxCalc will report "-2"
  Both results are correct.
  <a href="../other/cpidos.htm">CODEPAGE</a> &amp; LOCALES:
  As there are some buttons which are described with ASCII characters
  greater than ASCII #127, FoxCalc detects the system's codepage and
  changes the buttons descriptions if the codepage can't display them
  correctly. For example, the square button is "&sup1;" on CP437, and "SQR"
  on CP850. The separators (decimal separator and thousands separator)
  are copied from the system's settings. If you would like to
  change them, just change your system's settings (usually using 
  <a href="../base/cntrysys.htm">COUNTRY.SYS</a>).
