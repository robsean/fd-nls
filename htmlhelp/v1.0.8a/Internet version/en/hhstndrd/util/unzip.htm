<h1>Command: unzip</h1>
<pre>
  UNZIP lists, tests, or extracts files from a ZIP archive, commonly found
  on DOS systems. The default behavior (with no options) is to extract
  all files from the specified ZIP archive into the current directory
  (and subdirectories below it). 
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  unzip [-Z] [-options[modifiers]] file[.zip] [file(s)] [-x xlist]
        [-d exdir]
          file[.zip]  Path of the ZIP archive(s). This may be a wildcard.
          [file(s)]   An optional list of archive members to be processed,
                      separated by spaces.
          [-d exdir]  An optional directory to which to extract files.
                      By default, all files and subdirectories are recre-
                      ated in the current directory; the -d option allows
                      extraction in an arbitrary directory.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
    -d   Extract files into exdir (an optional directory).
    -f   Freshen existing files, i.e., extract only those files that
         already exist on disk and that are newer than the disk copies.
    -l   List files (short format). The names, uncompressed file sizes and
         modification dates and times of the specified files are printed,
         along with totals for all files specified.
    -p   Extract files to pipe (standard output), no messages.
    -t   Test compressed archive data. This option extracts each specified
         file in memory and compares the CRC checksum of the expanded file
         with the original file's stored CRC value.
    -u   Update files, create new ones if necessary.
    -x   Exclude files that follow (in xlist). Xlist is an optional list
         of archive members to be excluded from processing. Since
         wildcard characters normally match ('/') directory separators
         this option may be used to exclude any files that are in
         subdirectories.
    -z   Display archive comment.
    -Z   ZipInfo mode. If the first option on the command line is -Z, the
         remaining options are taken to be zipinfo(1L) options.
  Modifiers:
    -$   Label removables (-$$ =&gt; fixed disks)
    -a   Auto-convert any text files.
    -aa  Treat ALL files as text files.
    -C   Match filenames case-insensitively.
    -j   Junk paths. The archive's directory structure is not recreated;
         all files are deposited in the extraction directory.
    -L   Make (some) names lowercase.
    -n   Never overwrite existing files.
    -o   Overwrite files WITHOUT prompting.
    -M   Pipe through "more" pager.
    -q   Quiet mode (-qq =&gt; quieter).
    -s   Convert spaces in filenames to '_'
    -v   Be verbose or print diagnostic version info.
    -V   Retain VMS version numbers.

  unzip data1 -x joe    extract all files except joe from zipfile
                        data1.zip
  unzip -fo foo ReadMe  quietly replace existing ReadMe if archive file
                        newer
