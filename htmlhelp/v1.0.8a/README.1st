It is NOT recommended to use this collection for help.exe as there are problems with
help.exe when there are special characters in the <h1>special character</h1> section
(help.exe hangs!). The english and german version should work with help.exe, but
the french and the spanish version still have some problems.

If you have questions, please send a mail to fritz dot mueller AT mail dot com.
