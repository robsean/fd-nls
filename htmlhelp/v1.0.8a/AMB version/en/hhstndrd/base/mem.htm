<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  This command is interesting if you have problems with crashing programs.
  With the command you can see if there is enough memory to execute the 
  program. If the lower memory is too small it may help to load the 
  program into high memory with the <a href="../command/lh.htm">LH</a> / <a href="../command/loadhigh.htm">LOADHIGH</a> command.
  MEM supports NLS (national language support).
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  mem /DEVICE /C /P
