<h1><a name="top" id="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - TCP/IP</h1>
<pre>
  The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP)
  is now the most widely used protocol to connect to a <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a>.
  TCP/IP was devised as an open standard via the RFC system, used to
  connect the Internet. Of the main protocols in use, TCP/IP is the only
  one that was <b>originally</b> designed to be used over Wide Area <a href="../network/network.htm">Networks</a>
  and not just on LANs.
  There have been a number of implementations of the TCP/IP stack for
  DOS (as it wasn't standardized by the OS). The most successful, as it is
  still in use, is <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a> (Waterloo TCP/IP Kernel) available from Erick
  Engelke. It is free to use, but the programmer's manual must be
  purchased. A 32-bit version of <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a> is also available.
  The <a href="../network/history.htm#bbf">KA9Q</a> TCP/IP stack was used in other applications, but is most found
  in the various versions of the NOS NET.EXE program, which includes
  applications (ftp, smtp, etc.) as part of the program.
  Most of the remaining TCP/IP stacks did not have any third party
  support, so when the original programmers stopped development, all
  applications development stopped too. These include the MIT/CMU pcip,
  Trumpet TCP/IP, TinyTCP and FreePASCAL TCP/IP stacks. To a lesser
  extent this also includes the Microsoft and <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a> TCP/IP stacks, and
  the various other commercial solutions.
