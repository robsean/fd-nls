<pre>
  The Crynwr packet driver collection provides <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> connectivity. They
  were written by Russell Nelson of Crynwr Software. These are based on the
  original ftp.com specification, a skeleton is freely available and most
  <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> card vendors will provide a packet driver. As this is an open
  standard it is the one most used by GNU and shareware programmers. (See
  also <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a>).
  There are "shims" which allow both <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> and <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a> NIC drivers to be used,
  but which the applications think are packet drivers.
  The Crynwr drivers are OSI Certified Open Source software. Unlike <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>
  or <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a>, the Packet Driver Specification is freely copyable.
