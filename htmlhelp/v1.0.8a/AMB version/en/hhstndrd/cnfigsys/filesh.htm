<h1>Command: fileshigh</h1>
<pre>
  FILESHIGH tells FreeDOS how many files it should be able to 
  have open simulataneously.
  FILESHIGH is a <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> / <a href="../cnfigsys/fdconfig.htm">FDCONFIG.SYS</a> command.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  fileshigh=n
    where n is the number of files, in the range 8-255. The default
    setting is 8, but a good number for most modern systems is 20 - 40.
    Some programs may need a higher setting to function correctly; such
    programs will usually give the value that is needed in their
    documentation.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  - none -
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  FILESHIGH specifies how many files are allowed open at once (reserves
  memory necessary to support opening this many files).
  Note: there are other restrictions, so a given program may not be able
  to actually open this amount. A good number is 20, though some programs
  suggest/require 30, 40, or even 255.
  FILESHIGH is like FILES, except it attempts to load into high memory 
  first (failing that it should load in conventional memory).
  Note: The order you load devices may have a large impact on amount
  of free memory available. In general try to load large (in memory
  usage) programs into high memory first.
  Important: You should have a high memory manager such as (<a href="../base/himem.htm">HIMEM</a>) or
  <a href="../base/himemx.htm">HIMEMX</a> or <a href="../base/jemmex.htm">JEMMEX</a> installed (prior device=himem.exe or device=himemx.exe
  in <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> / <a href="../cnfigsys/fdconfig.htm">FDCONFIG.SYS</a>) before using this option.
  FILESHIGH is a command internal to kernel.sys and needs no other file
  in order to work.
