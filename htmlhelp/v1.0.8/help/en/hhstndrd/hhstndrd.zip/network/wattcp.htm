<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - WatTCP/Watt-32</h1>
<h2><a name="zzz"></a>Overview:</h2>
<pre>
  Waterloo TCP (WatTCP) was written 1990 - 1992 at the University of
  Waterloo in Ontario (Canada). The author is Erick Engelke, then a
  developer in the Faculty of Engineering, today the university's
  <b>Director of Engineering Computing</b> (see: <b>http://www.eng.
  uwaterloo.ca/~erick/ (*01)</b>).
  The core TCP engine of WatTCP was based on Geoffrey H. Cooper's
  TinyTCP.
  WatTCP was originally released under a homebrewed public domain license
  - binary and source were free for use, distribution was allowed only
  for non-commercial reasons. In 2004 Erick Engelke copyrighted it under
  the terms of the GNU LGPL. WatTCP can be found at Erick Engelke's
  <b>homepage</b> (<b>http://www.erickengelke.com/wattcp/index.shtml (*02)</b>). While
  the software is free, the WatTCP Programmer's Reference is <b>sold as PDF
  for 50$</b> (see: <b>http://www.erickengelke.com/wattcp/docs.shtml (*03)</b>).
  WatTCP was ported to 32-bit by Gisle Vanem at Bergen, Norway in 1999.
  The port is called <b>Watt-32</b> (see: <b>http://home.broadpark.no/
  ~gvanem/ (*04)</b>). It supports 32-bit protected-mode as well as 16-bit
  real-mode. On the site you find binaries, source and documentation for
  download. More binaries that use the Watt-32 stack can be found <b>here</b>
  (see: <b>http://www.filegate.net/utiln/utilnet/wt32apps.zip (*05)</b>). There
  is a <b>developer forum</b> (see: <b>http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/
  watt-32/messages/2617?viscount=-30&amp;l=1 (*06)</b>) which is still active. 
  WatTCP and Watt-32 are not external <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">TCP/IP Kernels</a>. Both are just sets
  of <b>libraries</b> designated to programmers - they can use these libraries
  to implement <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> functions into their applications. The WatTCP
  package includes such applications with built-in WatTCP kernel like
  "ping", "finger", "whois" or "lpr".
  Many important DOS <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> applications use the WatTCP libraries like
  <a href="../network/tcpip_ap.htm#ccc">Arachne</a> or <a href="../network/tcpip_ap.htm#eee">SSH2DOS</a>. A list of these apps is available at "<b>DOS Solutions</b>"
  (<b>http://www.dossolutions.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/wattcp.htm (*07)</b>).

<h2><a name="aaa"></a>Installation and configuration:</h2>
<pre>
  So you don't have to download anything to use the WatTCP/Watt-32 kernel.
  It is already in the applications. The only thing needed is a confi-
  guration file, which is called "WATTCP.CFG" and is basically the same
  in both versions. It is located in the applications directory per
  default. The settings if you are working with fixed IPs:
      --- WATTCP.CFG ---
      # These are example values:
      my_ip = 192.168.1.10
      netmask = 255.255.255.0
      nameserver = 192.168.1.1
      nameserver = 129.97.128.196
      nameserver = 129.97.128.1
      gateway = 192.168.1.1
      # Uncomment, if your receive your configuration via DHCP
      # my_ip = dhcp
  If you are receiving your settings by a DHCP-server/router:
      --- WATTCP.CFG ---
      my_ip = dhcp
      netmask = 255.255.255.0
      gateway = 0.0.0.0
      domain_list = your.domain.com
      # domain, gateway, ip, nameserver will be set via DHCP 
  If the application is not in the same directory as WATTCP.CFG, please
  set WATTCP.CFG=\path\to\file to point to it (in <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a>).
  Additional settings may be needed by the applications used. A deeper
  introduction into the use of WatTCP programs can be found <b>here</b>
