<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  [drive]path  The drive and path where the shell is to look for the 
               transient part of the program. This is usually only 
               needed to set the COMSPEC.
  device       An alternate device for all i/o.
  /e:nnnnn     The environment size, in bytes, in the range 160-32768.
               This number will be rounded up the nearest 16 bytes.
               The default is 256.
  /p           Makes the shell permanent, so the EXIT command does 
               not exit the shell.
  /c {string}  Executes the command in {string}, then exits.
  /msg         Loads any error messages that might be stored on disk 
               into memory.
  Command (command.com) is also named FreeCom. It contains a lot of 
  internal commands which need no other file in order to work. You can 
  find the list of internal commands <a href="../../index.htm#command">here</a>.
