</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  For performance reasons DELTREE overwrites the first letter of each
  filename/directory name by a '?'. It does not delete the file
  itself, but it deallocates the space where the content of the file is
  written. FreeDOS, as other DOSes, recognizes the renamed file/directory
  (myfile.txt becomes ?yfile.txt; pathname becomes ?athname) as deleted,
  no longer shows it and does not offer access to it. Programs like
  <a href="../base/debug.htm">DEBUG</a> which have sector access are able to read the contents of the
  file/directory. As long as you do not write on the drive you have a
  chance to restore the files/directories again with <a href="../base/undelete.htm">UNDELETE</a>, only
  the first character of the filename/directory name will be lost 
  (_yfile.txt /_athname). The only ways to delete the file CONTENTS FOR
  ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN are to fill the disk completely with other files or
  by using a wipeout tool. The only way to delete a file/directory
  NAME FOR ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN is to <a href="../command/rename.htm">RENAME</a> <a href="../command/ren.htm">(REN)</a> the file/directory
  first (e.g. "a."/"a") and to delete it later (only correct at 8.3 -
  not at long filenames/directory names!)
  Switches must be before filespecs on command line - MS compatible 
  syntax! Otherwise they will be ignored.
  Filespecs may name files, subdirectories, or DR DOS-style file lists.
  DELTREE is a dangerous command!  Use at your own risk.
  DELTREE has the following <a href="../batch/if.htm#comment">EXITCODES (ERRORLEVEL)</a>:
    00  Success
    01  Something could not be deleted
    03  User abort (Q, control-C)
    16  General syntax error, or buffer overflow
    17  Not enough memory
    18  DOS 3.0 or better required
    19  Problem with list file
    20  Internal buffer overflow
    21  Error resolving directory name (dots_fix)
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  deltree /y c:\oldtree
  deltree c:\test2\   asks for each subdirectory of \test2 if you really
                      want to delete it
  deltree c:\test2    deletes all subdirectory of \test2 
</pre>
